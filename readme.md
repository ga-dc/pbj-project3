### Overview

While your last project taught you how to get started with Ruby, SQL, & Ruby on Rails, this project you'll be building something exciting with **Express & Sequelize.**

Your instructors will partner you with other classmates to architect, design, and collaboratively build an API of your own design.

**This is meant to push you both technically and collaboratively.** It's a lot harder to work in a team than to work by yourself, but that's most likely you're going to find yourself doing in your first development job after WDI, and **it's important to learn how to work together.**

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Don't hesitate** to write throwaway code to solve short-term problems.
* **Read the docs** for whatever technologies / frameworks / API's you plan to use. (See ["RTFM"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM))
* **Write your code DRY** and build your APIs RESTful.
* **Be consistent** with your code style. You're working in teams, but you're only making one app per team. Make sure it looks like a unified effort.
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don't be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **Keep user stories small** and well-defined. Remember: user stories focus on what a user *needs*, not what development tasks need accomplishing.
* **Write code another developer wouldn't have to ask you about**. Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is? (See ["self-documenting"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-documenting))
* **Make it all well-formatted.** Are you indenting consistently? Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc?
* **Comment your code.** Will someone understand what is going on in each block or function? Even if it's obvious, explaining the what and why means someone else can pick it up and get it.
* **Write pseudocode** before you write actual code. Thinking through the logic of something helps.

### Potential Project Ideas

For this project, work with your team to build a creative product that you actually think someone will want to use. We won't have time to do tons of customer research, but take some time to brainstorm. If you're struggling for ideas, the ones below could help get you started.

#### Bucketli.st
Besides finishing WDI, you surely have one or two things you'd love to do with your life. Let's get 'em on paper! You could integrate with a third-party location-based API to allow users to search for a location or venue to add to their bucket list items.

#### Survey App
Imagine sending out a survey to everyone in the class: what should we eat for lunch today? Or 1-5, how well did you understand what we just learned? It would be even more awesome if it were realtime, so you could see answers pouring in as they're submitted.

#### Hello, Comments
Imagine the benefits of having an API where you could embed comments into any website you want. They could even update in realtime if you wanted, so that you'd never have to refresh the page. CMS providers across the world could quit writing code from scratch and just embed your widget instead.

### Evaluation and Submission

Each member of the group must submit a pull request to the `pbj-project3` repository by *12:30 pm, Friday, August 28th**.

[See the requirements for the contents of the submission here.](evaluation.md)

Feedback will be returned to you by **9:00 am, Monday, August 31st**.

Note that instructors will *not* be grading on a numbered scale this time. Projects will simply be either "meets expectations" or "does not meet expectations".

---

### Attendance

Attendance will be taken at 9:00am on Tuesday, and at 12:00pm on Wednesday. Groups are otherwise welcome to work outside of GA at their collective discretion.

---

### Support

Instructors will be checking Github issues to respond to technical questions.

Additionally, each group will receive 3 "tokens" for 20 minutes of in-person instructor support. These may be redeemed any time during business hours: simply Slack the instructor and they'll come as quickly as possible. Unused minutes don't "roll over".

For existential questions, and/or those regarding expectations, instructors may be reached via Slack at any time, inside and outside of business hours (although they may be somewhat slower to respond outside of business hours).

---

### Presentations

Each group will present their project to the class starting at **1:30pm on Friday, August 28th**.

The presentations will take the following structure. Each section detailed below should be presented by a different group member. The entire presentation may be **no longer than 10 minutes**; therefore, each section below should be no longer than **2 - 3 minutes**.

- Introduction
  - What's your app called?
  - Who are your group members? Who had which responsibilities?
  - Why is it useful? What is your "pitch"?
- Demonstrating your app
  - What are the **coolest** features of your app?
- Demonstrating your code
  - What was the most difficult part?
  - What did you learn?
  - What are you most proud of?
- The planning process
  - How did you arrive at this idea?
  - How did you decide who would have which responsibilities?
  - What would you change about your planning process?
- For groups with 5 members: Highs and lows
  - What worked well?
  - What didn't?
  - What features would you like to add?

Following the 10-minute presentation, 5 minutes will be allotted for questions. This will not be factored into the evaluation.

[Evaluation guidelines for presentations may be seen here.](evaluation.md)
