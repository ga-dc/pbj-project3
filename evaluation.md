## Technical Requirements

### Back-end
- Your API includes at least 2 models, one of which may be a user
- Your models include at least one association
- At least one model includes all CRUD functions via RESTful routes

### Front-end
- Your app is enjoyable to use
- Your app includes at least one view
- Your view(s) includes at least one AJAX request that allows a user to somehow interact with the API
- Your code, as rendered in the browser, passes a [CSS validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and an [HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

### Publication
- Your code is commented only with what is necessary do document what is happening in your code; that is, there are no commented-out chunks of unused code
- Your submission is received via a pull request to the [pbj-project3](https://github.com/ga-dc/pbj-project3) Github repository [on time](readme.md)
- The submission contains:
  - Comfort score, out of 5
  - Completeness score, out of 5
  - At least 3 specific areas of code on which you would like targeted feedback
  - Any other comments or questions
- Your repository includes at least **one** *significant* commit from **every** member of your team on **each** day
- Your submitted Github repository includes a `planning` folder that contains:
  - A minimum of 5 user stories
  - A minimum of 1 ERD
  - A minimum of 3 wireframes and/or mock-ups
- Your repository includes a link to the deployed version of your project in the repository `URL` field
- The repository includes a `readme.md` file containing:
  - A couple paragraphs about the general approach you took
  - Installation instructions for any dependencies
  - Descriptions of any unsolved problems or major hurdles your team had to overcome

### Deployment and functionality
- Your application is deployed to Heroku (optional, but encouraged: with a custom URL)
- Cursory use of your app yields no errors that "break" your app
- What is on Heroku appears to be identical to what is on Github

### Presentation
- All group members presented in roughly equal amounts
- The [provided structure](readme.md) was followed
- The presentation was enjoyable to experience
- The points presented were compelling, both in content **and delivery**
